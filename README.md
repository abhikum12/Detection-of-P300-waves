# Detection-of-P300-waves
P300 are elicited potentials that are neccessary for various medical purposes. Our aim is to classify the samples in a binary way.
The code was written using Jupyter Notebook. It can be opened online using Jupyter.
We have been given a sample of 64*64 EEG data after recording the elicited potential from numerous subjects. Our aim is to detect the presence of P300 waves in a single trial.
